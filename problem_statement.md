# Phase III - Case Study Competition || Code to Connect || Hackathon 2026

## Problem Statement

The objective of this case study is to design and implement a platform capable of ingesting and analyzing real-time, unstructured data to generate actionable financial risk signals.

The primary deliverable is a unified **AI/NLP Risk Engine**. This engine will serve as the central processing unit, responsible for parsing text-based data from sources such as news feeds and social media, and converting it into structured output.

Upon completion of the core engine, teams are required to implement **at least one** of the following downstream modules to demonstrate a practical application of the generated risk intelligence:

- **Module A**: A tactical, high-frequency stock index rebalancer.
- **Module B**: A strategic, event-driven portfolio stress-testing tool.

The project is structured modularly to allow for focused development on distinct components within the specified timeframe.

## 2. The Core Challenge: The AI/NLP Risk Engine

Your primary task is to build a robust data pipeline and NLP model that can ingest text from various sources and output structured, machine-readable risk signals.

### Engine Requirements:

- **Data Ingestion:** The engine must be able to process text from at least two different sources (e.g., financial news articles and Twitter/X posts).
- **NLP-Driven Analysis:** The engine must analyze the text and, for a given company or event, output structured data with the following fields:
  - **Sentiment Score:** A numerical score indicating positive, negative, or neutral sentiment (e.g., from -1.0 to 1.0).
  - **Event Classification:** A categorical label for the type of event discussed (e.g., *Geopolitical*, *Macroeconomic*, *Credit Event*, *Merger/Acquisition*, *Product Launch*).
  - **Impact Score:** A predicted severity score (e.g., 1-10) indicating the potential market impact of the event.
- **Output:** The engine should make these structured signals available for consumption by downstream applications, for example, through a simple API or by writing to a file.

## 3. Downstream Applications (Choose at least ONE)

Once your AI/NLP Risk Engine is operational, you must build at least one of the following modules to demonstrate its capabilities.

### Module A: Tactical Index Rebalancing

- **Objective:** Create a system that dynamically rebalances a mock stock index (e.g., a selection of 10-20 stocks from the S&P 100) based on real-time sentiment.
- **Functionality:**
  - This module will subscribe to the **Sentiment Score** from your NLP Risk Engine.
  - For each stock in your mock index, the system will adjust the stock's weight in the portfolio:
    - **Positive Sentiment:** Increase the weight of the stock.
    - **Negative Sentiment:** Decrease the weight of the stock.
  - **Visualization:** Create a simple dashboard that visualizes the changing weights of the stocks in your index over time.

### Module B: Strategic Portfolio Stress Testing

- **Objective:** Design a conceptual tool that simulates the impact of major real-world events on a synthetic portfolio of wholesale banking assets.
- **Functionality:**
  - This module will subscribe to the **Event Classification** and **Impact Score** from your NLP Risk Engine.
  - Define a synthetic portfolio using the provided sample transaction data. The portfolio should include a mix of asset types (e.g., loans, bonds, derivatives).
  - When a high-impact event is detected (e.g., *Geopolitical* with an Impact Score > 7), the module will trigger a "stress test."
  - **Stress Test Simulation:** For the purpose of the hackathon, the stress test can be a simplified model. For example, you can define a set of shocks (e.g., a 10% drop in all equity prices, a 2% increase in interest rates) that are applied to your portfolio when a specific event type is detected.
  - **Visualization:** Create a dashboard that shows the portfolio's value before and after the stress test, highlighting the impact of the simulated event.

## 4. Open-Source Datasets and Resources

To ensure this case study is implementable, here are several free, open-source datasets and APIs that you can use. You are encouraged to use these as a starting point and augment them with other sources you find. All listed resources have free tiers and do not require payment.

### Unstructured Data for NLP (News & Social Media)

| Resource | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The GDELT Project** | A massive, open database that monitors global news media in over 100 languages, updated every 15 minutes. It categorizes events and themes, making it perfect for the NLP Risk Engine. | Ingesting a real-time, categorized feed of global events to power the Event Classification and Impact Score in your NLP engine. |
| **Financial News Sentiment Datasets (Kaggle)** | Kaggle hosts numerous datasets with financial news headlines and articles, often pre-labeled with sentiment. A popular example is the "Sentiment Analysis for Financial News" dataset. | Training or fine-tuning your Sentiment Score model. Can also be used for back-testing your strategies. |
| **News API (newsapi.org)** | Provides a free developer plan to fetch recent news articles from thousands of sources. It's great for getting real-time headlines and articles for your demo. | A live source of news for your NLP engine. |
| **Historical Stock Tweets (Kaggle)** | Datasets like "Tweet Sentiment's Impact on Stock Returns" contain millions of tweets related to specific stocks, often with sentiment polarity scores. | A rich source for training your sentiment model and understanding the relationship between social media and stock returns. |

### Financial Data (Transactions & Market Prices)

| Resource | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **yfinance Python Library** | An extremely popular and easy-to-use library to download historical market data for stocks, indices, and currencies directly from Yahoo Finance. | Fetching historical price data for Module A (Index Rebalancing) and Module B (Stress Testing). |
| **Alpha Vantage** | Offers a free API for real-time and historical data on stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies, including technical indicators. | An alternative or supplement to yfinance for fetching market data. |
| **Salad Money Open Banking Transaction Data** | A secure dataset containing anonymized transaction-level data from UK key workers. It includes spending categories, amounts, and demographic information. | An excellent source for creating a realistic synthetic portfolio for Module B, with varied transaction types and user profiles. |
| **Financial Transactions Dataset (Kaggle)** | This dataset combines transaction records, customer information, and card data, designed for fraud detection and customer behavior analysis. | Another great option for building the synthetic portfolio in Module B, providing a rich set of features for analysis. |
